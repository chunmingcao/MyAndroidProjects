        dic.put("Confession", "Take time to listen to the Spirit as He brings to mind areas where you have sinned. Humbly and willingly confess those things to God. Confession should be a part of your continual walk with Christ (see Matt. 6:9-13). Remember that when you honestly confess, God will forgive and cleanse you because of what Jesus has done on your behalf (1 John 1:9). Also bear in mind that confession without repentance (a desire to turn from the sin) does little good. It is the one who confesses and forsakes his sin who will receive the Lord’s mercy (Proverbs 28:13).");
        dic.put("Thanksgiving", "In our prayers we should always have hearts that are filled with gratitude for all the goodness and blessing our God has given us. We are instructed by the word of God to give thanks as we pray (Phil. 4:6-7). This includes thanking God for specific things such as blessings, people, opportunities, guidance, and much more. And don’t forget to thank Him for the great gift of salvation that you have received through Jesus");
        dic.put("Supplication", "Supplication is an older word, meaning “ask.” Under this heading you ask God for the things you need, for His wisdom in the circumstances of your life, for His guidance for you and others. Intercessory prayer (your prayers for others – Heb. 10:19-25; Rev. 1:4-6) fits in here as well. Spend time praying for specific people, events, government officials, missionaries, the spread of the gospel message, etc. (see Acts 12:5; Rom. 10:1). You may find it helpful to make a prayer list to help you in this section. It is helpful on that list to include a place for answers to your prayers, that way you can use those answers as opportunities for praise and thanksgiving.");
